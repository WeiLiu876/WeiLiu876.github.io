About me
====
I am currently a research fellow at National University of Singapore, co-advised by Prof. [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and Prof. [Wee Sun Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/).   
Previously, I received my Ph.D. from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2024 (advisor: Prof. [Ruixuan Li](http://idc.hust.edu.cn/rxli/index.html)) and my B.S. from HUST in 2019.

Research
====


- My recent research has been concentrating on various issues related to large language models. I am looking for collaboration partners, and interested individuals are welcome to contact me.
