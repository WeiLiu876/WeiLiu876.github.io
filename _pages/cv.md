Research Interests
======
 My research primarily focuses on explainable artificial intelligence, utilizing theoretical tools such as causality, probabilistic graphical models, and information theory. I have published a series of papers in the field of explainable AI, including top-tier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS, KDD, and ACL. The objective of my work is to identify simple and principled approaches that are both practical and scalable. 

Currently, I am interested in various research areas related to large language models, especially data quality and interpretability.
