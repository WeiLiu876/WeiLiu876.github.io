title: "FR: Folded Rationalization with a Unified Encoder"

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: '- **Task:** Self-explaining rationalization in NLP
- **Problem:** Degeneration. That's to say, in a cooperative game, the predictor and the generator (i.e., rationalizer) may collude to use uninformative rationale candidates to get the right label.
- **Insights:** If the whole model achieves high prediction accuracy, the generator can always learn the true semantic.
- **Solution:** Sharing the encoders between the generator and the predictor, which is very simple and is compatible with many variants of this kind of two-player rationaliser/classifier games. '
