- **Task:** Self-explaining rationalization in NLP
- **Problem:** Degeneration. That's to say, in a cooperative game, the predictor and the generator (i.e., rationalizer) may collude to use uninformative rationale candidates to get the right label.
- **Insights:** We first link the degeneration problem to the predictor's Lipschitz continuity. And then we link the predictor's Lipschitz continuity to the coordination of the predictor and the generator.
- **Solution:** Slow down the predictor, which is very simple and is compatible with many variants of this kind of two-player rationaliser/classifier games.
